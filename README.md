# Reddit Bot
To start the reddit bot you should run the Main.py File.


This Reddit bot performs 2 things:

**First** :You give the bot a sentence to search for and a reply for this sentence if it founds it.
It will reply to all posts/comments that have this sentence with the reply you provided it.
<br>**Example** :
If sentence the bot will search for is "i love python", reply of bot is "me too"
Every post/comment contains "i love python" the bot will reply with "me too".
The post/comment is replied to only one time.

**Second** : You can Send a message to anyone on Reddit by writing his/her **username**, **the title of message** and **the body of the message**.

There are a list of things that are changable from account to another
```
client_id

username
```
**Note**  **   
In this Reddit we are working on "pythonforengineers" subbredit , you can change it and work on any subbreddit.
